A MVC restaurant analytics tool to discover trends and generate financial statements. Not finished and is still heavily a work-in-progress.

Part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in Java.

List of Views:

- `ProductView`: to add new products into the application.

Will continue to update this project in the future. Feel free to fork this project.
